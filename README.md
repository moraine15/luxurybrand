✨ About This Project
Christian Wijaya is a front-end website project designed to represent the identity of a luxury fashion brand. Its goal is to create a sophisticated, minimalist, and functional online platform that reflects the elegance and high quality of its products. This project consists of five fully responsive main pages, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.

🎨 Design & Prototyping
The entire user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) were designed and prototyped in Figma before the development phase. This allowed for a clear and consistent design vision, focusing on a clean aesthetic that embodies the luxury of the Christian Wijaya brand.
